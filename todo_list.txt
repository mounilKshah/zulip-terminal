It's possible to indicate "headings" at different levels, akin to h1-h6 in html, using markdown - this currently just appears as plain text.

This would be a good issue for someone new; here are some suggestions for implementation:

1. identify the html generated by the server (inspect in the browser)
2. examine the existing tests for soup2markup and think how they'd be extended
3. add heading styles in themes (and required styles) and add a case to the soup2markup test (this new test should fail)
4. explore where the code needs adding in soup2markup; add it and ensure the test now passes :)
test manually in #test here on chat.zulip.org :)
